		<h1>tl;dr PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
		<p>Last updated: June 8, 2023</p>
		<p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use our App (the "Service").</p>
		<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
		<p>We only collect information necessary to provide our Service to you:</p>
		<h3>1.1 Anonymous Purchase Information</h3>
		<p>When you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Service, we collect certain information from you, including the details related to the purchase. However, this data is anonymized and cannot be traced back to you as an individual.</p>
		<h3>1.2 Unique Customer Identifiers</h3>
		<p>We generate a unique anonymous identifier for each customer to track usage and provide better service. This identifier does not contain any personal information or any data that could be used to identify you.</p>
		<h3>1.3 URL Data</h3>
		<p>When you use the Service to summarize a webpage, we collect the URL of the webpage that you chose to summarize. We do not collect any additional data from the webpage or about your browsing history.</p>
		<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
		<p>We use the anonymized purchase information to track the number of users and the revenue generated by the Service.</p>
		<p>Unique customer identifiers are used to manage subscriptions and provide better service, such as maintaining your preferences.</p>
		<p>We use the URL data to provide the summary service and to improve the effectiveness of our technology. The URL data also helps us to ensure that our Service is used in accordance with our terms and conditions.</p>
		<h2>3. Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>
		<p>As we do not collect any personally identifiable information, there is no personal information to share. However, we may share anonymous, aggregate data with our technology partners, such as OpenAI, for the purpose of improving our Service.</p>
		<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
		<p>We will maintain your Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.</p>
		<h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
		<p>As a user, you have the right to access the anonymous information we hold about you, and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.</p>
		<h2>6. Changes</h2>
		<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>
		<h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
		<p>For more information about our privacy practices, if you have questions, or if you would like to make a complaint, please contact us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@im3software.com">privacy@im3software.com</a>.</p>
